            Inspect the car, preferably in person:
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Be wary of sellers who refuse to meet in person, face to face.
                </li>
                <li>Use caution if the seller only wants to communicate via email or text message.
                </li>
                <li>Be extremely wary if the seller refuses to or claims they cannot talk on the phone.
                </li>
                <li>If possible, have a car mechanic join you and inspect the vehicle before you pay to complete a sale.
                </li>
                <li>Exercise caution if the seller states the vehicle must be shipped or is currently not in their physical possession.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="">
                Learn about a vehicleâ€™s history:
            </h4>
            <p>
Consider purchasing a vehicle history report such as those offered by Carfax. While vehicle history reports do not necessarily include every piece of information about a used car, they can be a helpful tool to identify major issues or defects, general location and more.
It can be indicative of auto fraud if the seller is unable or unwilling to provide the vehicle identification number or a copy of the title
